# Risk-Game-Project
The Hasbro Game Of Global Domination

RISK, the 2-6 players game of global domination.

This game is written in Java with a team of four students using IntelliJ IDEA for Java and Github for version control.

For the first milestone of the project, a text based version of the game will be created with the source code and compiled code being put in a .jar. The game will feature simplified features of the classic strategy game RISK, skipping a few elements such as the army placing phase and the bonus card mechanics that the fully featured RISK game has. In addition, a readme file listing the explanation of the rest of deliverables, the names of the authors, and known issues will be created.
