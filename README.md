# Risk-Game-Project
The Hasbro Game Of Global Domination

RISK, the 2-6 players game of global domination.

This game is written in Java with a team of four students using IntelliJ IDEA with Java and Git/Github for version control.

For the first milestone of the project, a text based version of the game will be created with the source code and compiled code being put in a .jar. The game will feature simplified features of the classic strategy game RISK, skipping a few elements such as the army placing phase and the bonus card mechanics that the fully featured RISK game has. In addition, a readme file listing the explanation of the rest of deliverables, the names of the authors, and known issues will be created.

Before starting the work on the project, the group members met up together on the steam game version of RISK as the source of inspiration where they disscussed and analyzed the features and detail mechanics of the game. Some notable insights were found on the dice roll mechanics of RISK, where the player can choose to either fight one on one dice rolls or in the style of three dice versus three dice rolls, opening up to different avenues of attacks for the players.

Beginning the project, the group will first begin a rough draft of the workflow milestones, documentation and readme files to offer the project members a sense of direction in where the project is going to be and detail what kind work everyone has in front of them. And then all the members of the group will then tackle the UML diagram and write up a rough draft of the different classes methods of the Java game with google sheets as a group brainstorming platform before writing the final deliverable UML diagram using violet. The UML diagram will include how they would interact with each other to offer a guideline for the coding part of the text based Java project file next.

This is because it is important to first design the guidelines of the project workflow and gain understanding of the design requirements because mistakes can usually happen if the project members jump into the coding portions of the project first thing without having a complete understanding of the requirements.

The next major phase would be to write up the codes for the Java game. Though when we are in this phase of writing the code, we do not constrain ourselves to simply writing the codes, as the coding process also work in parallel with the UML team, changing requirements to better fit the project stakeholder (the course)â€™s expectations and editing the code to better fit the requirements when a conflict of requirements was found.

Through the process of writing, editing, and re-editing, this phase will lead up to producing the final deliverables of Milestone 1, with all the necessary changes and steps towards perfection being delivered before the Sunday October 25th due date.

We hope through this project we will experience, learn, and share many insights and great moments in the project life cycle of a software programmer in the modern era.

And we hope you, the person reading this, whether you are a teaching assistant, professor, code enthusiast, fellow student, to be as delighted as us when we created this project.

From yours truly,
